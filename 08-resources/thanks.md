# Thanks

I'd like to use this space to thank my friends, family, and past and present coworkers for helping me to make this book possible. So many people have been supportive, offered advice or consultation, helped with fact-checking, proofreading, and more, and made contributions to improve this work.

In particular, I'd like to thank Chris Van (@cvanw) for his incessant focus on performance and attention to detail. Your pull requests and comments, as well as your ever-inquisitive nature have driven me to make this book as thorough and exhaustively accurate as I could possibly make it.
