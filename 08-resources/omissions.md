# Omissions

There are many aspects of performance that were not considered as part of this book. Some were omitted due to their complexity, others were omitted due to brevity. This is a semi-complete list of things that are not discussed in this book but may be interesting to the reader.


## Instant Articles and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)

Instant Articles (pioneered by Facebook) and Accelerated Mobile Pages (pioneered by Google) are technologies designed to improve mobile reading experiences. The technologies work differently but ultimately accomplish the same goal: minimizing page load time for mobile-friendly pages.

Instant Articles and AMP can provide incredible performance benefits, but their usefulness may be limited in many scenarios. Most interactive content is not compatible with either technology. You should consider the limitations of each before implementing one solution or the other.
